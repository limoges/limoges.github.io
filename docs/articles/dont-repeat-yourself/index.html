    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourselfkkkkkk">Don&rsquo;t repeat yourself</a> is a pretty popular principle of software development.</p>

<p>It has (funnily) been repeated, over and over and over again. To the point where
it seems to be the most important principle to some software communities.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the principle is flawed. It is a good idea to try and group
repetitive code. But everything must be done in moderation. Sometimes, <a href="https://gist.github.com/harssh-sparkway/8707634">DRY just
makes it damn more complicated to understand your code</a>.</p>

<p>When you try and force an abstraction to achieve the absolute DRY-ness, your code
becomes hard to read. It becomes obfuscated magic and increases the burden
for those who must maintain it in the future.</p>

<p>So, please, feel free to <strong>Repeat Yourself</strong>. Sometimes, that&rsquo;s how people understand.</p>

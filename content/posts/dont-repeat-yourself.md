[Don't repeat yourself][1] is a pretty popular principle of software development.

It has (funnily) been repeated, over and over and over again. To the point where
it seems to be the most important principle to some software communities.

Unfortunately, the principle is flawed. It is a good idea to try and group
repetitive code. But everything must be done in moderation. Sometimes, [DRY just
makes it damn more complicated to understand your code][2].

When you try and force an abstraction to achieve the absolute DRY-ness, your code
becomes hard to read. It becomes obfuscated magic and increases the burden
for those who must maintain it in the future.

So, please, feel free to **Repeat Yourself**. Sometimes, that's how people understand.

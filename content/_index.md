Hi there! My name is Julien. I'm a computer engineer working in software. I 
occasionally write on different topics I find interesting. I'm originally from 
[Montreal], but have lived in [Vancouver], [Lyon], [Vienna] and [Munich].

I’m currently doing a small amount of freelance work while working on a small 
business project I’ve been looking to build.

I am a multilinguist which mostly work with [Golang], but have worked with 
[Ruby] on the [probably largest rails app][rails] at [Shopify]. I've also worked 
on [serious] [mobile] [apps]. 

I'm pretty good with code but find satisfaction working with teams, developing 
expertise in our domain and working towards a codebase based on [SOLID]
engineering principles.

On the personal side, I enjoy [hiking the alps], traveling the world,
learning new spoken languages and improving my skills in the arts of guitar and
painting.

## Articles

I am currently regrouping and re-editing the articles I've written overtime.
They will be available here soon.
